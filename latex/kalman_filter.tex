\section{Kalman Filter}
\label{sec:KalmanFilter}
Kalman Filter can be interpreted as an extension of the recursive least squares seen at subsection~\ref{subsec:recursive_ls}, for those cases where the state of the system we want to estimate changes over the time, so it has a certain known dynamics, so the algorithm can take benefit of this knowledge of the system motion.

This chapter firstly introduces the basic version of the Kalman Filter, and thereafter explains other useful extensions such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Error State Kalman Filter. The main bibliographic source of inspiration was the book in~\cite{simon06}.

\subsection{Kalman Filter (KF)}
Given a dynamic system whose states we want to estimate:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}^t & = \mathbf{F}^t\mathbf{x}^{t-1} + \mathbf{G}^t\mathbf{u}^{t} + \mathbf{n}^t_x \label{eq:dynamic_system_1}\\
\mathbf{z}^t & = \mathbf{H}^t\mathbf{x}^t + \mathbf{n}^t_z \label{eq:dynamic_system_2}
\end{align} 
with 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{n}^t_x \approx \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{C}^t_{n_x}), \ \ \mathbf{n}^t_z \approx \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{C}^t_{n_z})
\end{equation}
so both the system dynamics (first equation) and measurement model (second equation) are considered random processes, with a certain degree of uncertainty modelled by the two Gaussian variables~$\mathbf{n}^t_x$ and~$\mathbf{n}^t_z$. This uncertainty comes not only from typical noise, but also from unmodelled effects, such as non-linearities not taken into account in such a linear description of the system. 

We define two types of state estimates. The \textit{prior} estimate, also called \textit{prediction}, is the estimate considering measurements up to the last iteration and one step of the dynamic model. It is indicated by underlinning the~$t$ superindex:
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\mathbf{x}}^{\underline{t}} = \mathcal{E}\{\mathbf{x}^t\ |\ \mathbf{z}^1,\mathbf{z}^2,\dots \mathbf{z}^{t-1},\}
\end{equation}
and the \textit{posterior} estimate, also called \textit{correction}, is the estimate taken into account the current measurement~$\mathbf{z}^{t}$, so the prediction gets corrected by it:
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\mathbf{x}}^{t} = \mathcal{E}\{\mathbf{x}^t\ |\ \mathbf{z}^1,\mathbf{z}^2,\dots \mathbf{z}^{t},\}
\end{equation}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:kalman_filter} summarizes the Kalman Filter, where iterations run over a predicition step and a correction one.

		    + \mathbf{K}^t\mathbf{C}^t_{n_z}(\mathbf{K}^t)^T$ //Update the covariance of the state estimate
\RETURN $\hat{\mathbf{x}}^t,\mathbf{C}^t_x$		    
\STATE END FOR
\end{algorithmic}
\label{alg:kalman_filter}
\end{algorithm}

In the \textbf{prediction step}, the prior estimate is computed,~$\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{\underline{t}}$, by making a prediction of the state one time-lapse further, thanks to consider the last posterior estimate,~$\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{t-1}$, the known dynamics,~$\mathbf{F}^t$, and possible control inputs to the system,$~\mathbf{G}^t$ and~$\mathbf{u}^t$. In the other hand, the \textbf{correction step} uses the current measurement to improve the prediction, following the same approach used in the recursive least squares (see subsection~\ref{subsec:recursive_ls}), but computing the expected measurement,~$\hat{\mathbf{z}}^t$, at the state point found in the prediction step. 

Depending on the application, this alternate between prediction and correction steps can be modified. For instance, several prediction steps could be computed between two corrections. In multi-sensor cases, some correction steps may involve only a partial subset of measurements, since it is common that not all sensors arrive in the Filter CPU at a same rate. Knowing that the fundamentals of the algorithm are the recursive least squares and the uncertainty propagation, different combinations of prediction and correction steps are completely correct from a theoretical point of view, and can provide practical benefits.

\paragraph{Observabililty Analysis} Observability is a property of a linear system, such as the one defined in equations~\ref{eq:dynamic_system_1} and~\ref{eq:dynamic_system_2}, that indicates if a state can be estimated/observed. It is important to check for the observability before starting to code an implementation of the Kalman Filter. The following procedure provides a way to perform this check. Given a system state of~$n$ dimensions, the observability matrix is mounted as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q} = 
\left[
 \begin{array}{c}
  \mathbf{H}\\
  \mathbf{H}\mathbf{F}\\
  \mathbf{H}\mathbf{F}^2\\
  \vdots\\
  \mathbf{H}\mathbf{F}^{n-1}\\
 \end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}
The system is observable if and only of the matrix~$\mathbf{Q}$ fulfills $rank(\mathbf{Q})=n$. Observability is the concept allowing us to estimate states that we do not directly measure, we just \textit{observe}.

\paragraph{Example \theexamplecounter. Object tracking in an image.}
\stepcounter{examplecounter}
Object detectors, such as ball or face detectors, typically provide pixel coordinate of the center of the target object at a given rate. However, they usually have false positive and false negative events, the first report detections when no target is present, the later not providing detections when the target is present in the scene. Therefore, it is always interesting to combine the output of a detector with a tracker, since the output of a tracking process provides smoother and more robust values of the object's position in the image.

Given a detector providing detections as object positions in image pixel coordinates, we consider, at iteration~$t$, this detection as the mesaurement:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{z}^t = [z^t_x\ \ z^t_y]^T \ ,
\end{equation}
and we define the state as:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{x}^t = [p^t_x\ \ p^t_y\ \ v^t_x\ \ v^t_y]^T.
\end{equation}
which are the position and the velocity of the object in pixel coordinates. Adding velocities to the state is useful in order to benefit from a dynamic model, even if it is simple, since Kalman filtering allows to exploit this knowledge through prior calculation. So the simple dynamic model we will consider is the following:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{x}^t = \mathbf{F}\mathbf{x}^{t-1} + \mathbf{n}^t_{x}; \ \ \ \
\mathbf{F}^t = \mathbf{F} = 
\left[
 \begin{array}{cccc}
  1 & 0 & \Delta\tau & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & \Delta\tau \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 \end{array}
 \right]; \ \ 
 \mathbf{C}^t_{n_x} = \mathbf{C}_{n_x} = 
\left[
 \begin{array}{cccc}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 25 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 25 \\
 \end{array}
 \right]; \ \ 
\end{equation}
where~$\Delta\tau$ is the time lapse between two iterations in seconds. This dynamic model do not consider control inputs ($\mathbf{u}^t$ in equation~\ref{eq:dynamic_system_1}) since the object is considered to move free, without any control from our system. The uncertainty associated to this dynamic model is characterized as a Gaussian noise, with a covariance matrix set from experimental experience, so it considers 1 pixel of standard deviation in position, 5 pixels of standard deviation in velocity and null covariance terms. Both matrixes~$\mathbf{F}$ and~$\mathbf{C}_{n_x}$ are considered constant, so the iteration superindex~$t$ has been removed. This dynamic model is called \textit{constant velocity} model, since assumes that the objects move thorugh the scene at a constant (linear) velocity. This may not be true, so uncertainty matrix has to be enough large to incorporate these model inaccuracies. This simple motion model may cause poor results, specially if time lapse~$\Delta\tau$ is large in comparison with the target speed, but increasing filter rate can mitigate this limitations leading to a better output.

The mesaurement model, which allows to compute the expected measurement from the state is:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{z}^t = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}^{t} + \mathbf{n}^t_{z}; \ \ \ \
\mathbf{H}^t = \mathbf{H} = 
\left[
 \begin{array}{cccc}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 \end{array}
 \right]; \ \ 
 \mathbf{C}^t_{n_z} = \mathbf{C}_{n_z} = 
\left[
 \begin{array}{cc}
  25 & 0 \\
  0 & 25 \\
 \end{array}
 \right]; \ \ 
\end{equation}
which is also a constant-time model, and just expects that the measurement is equal to the pixel position components of the state. The velocity part is not measured, so the matrix~$\mathbf{H}$ has only two rows. And the velocity part of the state do not contribute to the measurement, so the zeros in the third and fourth columns of~$\mathbf{H}$. Again, a 5 pixels standard deviation is considered to model the innacuracies of the detector. 

At this point we summarize the dimensions of the filter. The state space is 4-dimensional ($n=4$), while the measurement space is 2-dimensional ($m=2$). Let's check if this design pass the observability test:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{Q} = 
 \left[
 \begin{array}{cccc}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & \Delta\tau & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & \Delta\tau \\
  \vdots  
 \end{array}
\right]
\longrightarrow rank(\mathbf{Q})=4, 
\end{equation}
so the state is observable. 

To start running the filter, we only need to decide how to initialize it. In tracking applications, it is common to initialize the state with the values provided by a first detection, for the pixel position, and null values for the pixel velocities. The state covariance, could be initialized as:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{C}^0_x = 
 \left[
 \begin{array}{cccc}
  25 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & 25 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 100 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 100 \\
 \end{array}
 \right]
\end{equation}
