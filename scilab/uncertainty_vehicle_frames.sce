//A lidar sensor is mounted onboard a mobile platform, at position (1,0.5) with respect to the platform reference center and oriented 45ยบ with respect to the forward axis of the platform. The lidar is "seeing" a point called "q", at 5m with and angle of 30ยบ from its forward axis. 
//The lidar noise is modelled as Gaussian with standard deviations of 2cm for range and 0.025ยบ for azimuth. 

//Express the covariance matrix of the point in cartesian coordinates referenced at lidar frame and referenced at platform frame in the two following situations: 

//CASE 1: The mounting point of the sensor is known with complete precision (null uncertainty).

//CASE 2: The mounting point of the sensor is known with some degree of uncertainty, given by the standard deviation of 1mm for mounting position and 0.5ยบ for mounting orientation
